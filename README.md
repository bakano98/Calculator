# Calculator
with customisable buttons

Here, a calculator library was used for the calculator functions.

AsyncStorage was used as a method to remember data locally. 
Therefore, the settings that have been applied initially will be remembered by the device, and it will run with the correct settings on startup.


The following must be installed in order for the app to be functional on a local device.
@react-native-async-storage/async-storage
react-native-dialog-input

To install:
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-dialog-input
